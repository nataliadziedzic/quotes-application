# Quotes app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## How to use
1. Application opens at home page, click "next" button until it changes to "start" - when you choose "start" from menu you will be redirected to login page as well as after clicking the "start" button.
2. Click "Sign up" and fill in the fields according to the instructions.
